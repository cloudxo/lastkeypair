Sam->lkp_cli: lkp ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.1
lkp_cli->KMS: Encrypt a timestamp token with context:\n""from=sam"" \n""to=lkp_lambda"" \n""user=ec2-user"" \n""host=10.0.0.1""
note right of KMS: KMS will reject encryption API call if **from** \n context does not match user's IAM identity \n (due to key policy)
KMS->CloudTrail: kms:Encrypt with full context
KMS->lkp_cli: Returns ciphertext decryptable\nonly by LKP Lambda
lkp_cli->lkp_lambda: Ciphertext along with context \n and user SSH pubkey
lkp_lambda->KMS: Decrypt token with given context
note right of KMS: KMS will reject decryption API call if context not \n identical to context provided during encryption \n or **to** context does not match LKP Lambda's \n IAM execution role (due to key policy)
KMS->CloudTrail: kms:Decrypt with full context
KMS->lkp_lambda: Plaintext of validity window timestamp
lkp_lambda->lkp_auth: Authorization check using context
lkp_auth->lkp_lambda: Authorized=true/false
note right of lkp_lambda: Will only sign pubkey if a) authorizer \nisn't configured or b) authorizer \nreturns true
lkp_lambda->lkp_cli: Certificate of user pubkey signed by SSH CA
note left of lkp_cli: Certificate is valid for limited time. \n Time limit chosen by LKP Lambda
lkp_cli->10.0.0.1: ssh -o IdentityFile=... ec2-user@10.0.0.1
note right of 10.0.0.1: SSH server validates that cert is signed\n by trusted CA and isn't expired
